# Frontend Wedding Website

## Project Description 
This frontend program acts as a wedding styled website. It covers the wedding's main announcement, the couple's story, the event details, the wedding party and the wedding registration along with navigation, an RSVP form and a footer section. 

This frontend UI website was used to learn HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript's syntax and semantics through the operations of a wedding website.

A challege that came about was creating a dynamic RSVP form. The solution of having JavaScript method to detect if certain input fields were filled or checked will be helpful for futre uses of dynamic forms.

## Installation
If git is installed you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the filed directly. 

Once files are on your machine, extract or open the files. 

If using Visual Studio Code, you can install the "open in browser" extension to open the html files on a browser.

Just right click on the html file and click "Open in Default browser" or "Open in Other Browsers" to view the website.

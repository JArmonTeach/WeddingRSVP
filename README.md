# Frontend Wedding Website

## Project Description 
This frontend program acts as a wedding styled website. It covers the wedding's main announcement, the couple's story, the event details, the wedding party and the wedding registration along with navigation, an RSVP form and a footer section. 

This frontend UI website was used to learn HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript's syntax and semantics through the operations of a wedding website.

A challege that came about was creating a dynamic RSVP form. The solution of having JavaScript method to detect if certain input fields were filled or checked will be helpful for futre uses of dynamic forms.
